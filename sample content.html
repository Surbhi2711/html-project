<!--<h1>Java </h1> <h2>java is a programming language and a platform. </h2></br>Java is a high <b>level</b>, <strong>robust</strong>, object-oriented and secure programming language.

<p>java was developed</p> </br>by Sun Microsystems <i>(which is now the subsidiary of Oracle) </i><em>in the year 1995.</em> James Gosling is known as the father of Java. Before Java, its name was Oak. Since Oak was already a registered company, so James Gosling and his team changed the name from Oak to Java.

In the first solution, Service Level Agreement (SLA) is statically guaranteed but the utilization of servers is low and the
number of active servers is higher than the second solution, leading to higher energy consumption. In the second solution,
variation of the needed MIPS of the requests at any time may result in over-utilization of the processor; however, this
solution increases the utilization of ON servers resulting in an efficient use of datacenter resources. To avoid such cases,
an upper bound threshold value is considered for utilization of each server so when the utilization of the server surpasses
this threshold value, some of the VMs of this server are migrated to other physical machines to reduce probability of
instantaneous overutilization.

To optimize the operation of a datacenter, it is crucial to consider and minimize all energy components including
information technology (IT), cooling and network energy consumptions. Consolidation of multiple active VMs onto a single
physical server as well as consolidating multiple turned on servers into a single rack are examples of techniques that reduce
the energy overheads by decreasing the number of turned on racks and physical servers [14].

<blockquote> VM consolidation is used in
virtualized datacenters which typically provide internet-wide services such as mail and social networking. Therefore, it is
important to adopt simple and fast dynamic algorithms with low time complexity. This paper proposes four energy-aware
resource management algorithms for virtualized datacenters which leads to reduction in total energy consumption of datacenters.
With appropriate allocation of VMs to servers, the number of active servers can be decreased. This problem is similar
to the bin packing problem [7,10,15]. Bin packing is an NP-hard problem, and hence, approximation algorithms are typically
used to solve corresponding optimization problem. Some of the most well-known methods to assign VMs to PMs are First Fit
Decreasing, Round Robin and Best Fit Decreasing algorithms.
